reference link=>https://youtu.be/g7oQqN4dWM8
I copied the whole code of this project.Cut my marks thats not a problem. I just wanted to see how a json server works with app component because in flutter every thing is widget  so i can imazine updating the property but i could not image the same for react native which is completely different from flutter. Of course i ran the server created the server backed by myself following the instruction of this guy.These instruction is exactly similar to Arpit bro instruction but only thing is that this has uptime of 2 hours while his has uptime of 8 hours.
